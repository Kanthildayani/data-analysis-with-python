# README: Data Science Final Project

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Coursera Data Science course, where we analyze real estate data using Python. The tasks include data preprocessing, visualization, regression modeling, and performance evaluation using various machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8 or higher) along with the required libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## File Structure
- `Final-Assignment1.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing all the tasks
- `real_estate.csv` - The dataset used for analysis (ensure it is in the same directory as the notebook)

## Steps to Run the Notebook
1. **Open Jupyter Notebook**
   - Navigate to the project directory and run:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
   - Open `Final-Assignment1.ipynb`

2. **Load the dataset**
   - Ensure that `real_estate.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.

3. **Run the cells step by step**
   - Execute each cell sequentially to complete the required tasks.

4. **Take Screenshots**
   - As per the project requirements, take screenshots of outputs and submit them accordingly.

## Tasks Included
1. Displaying data types of each column
2. Dropping unnecessary columns and obtaining a statistical summary
3. Counting unique floor values
4. Creating a boxplot to analyze waterfront price outliers
5. Creating a regression plot for `sqft_above` vs. price
6. Performing linear regression to predict price using `sqft_living`
7. Performing multiple linear regression with multiple features
8. Creating a pipeline for scaling, polynomial transformation, and regression
9. Implementing Ridge Regression with a regularization parameter
10. Applying a second-order polynomial transform and Ridge Regression

## Troubleshooting
- **ModuleNotFoundError**: If a library is missing, install it using `pip install <library_name>`.
- **FileNotFoundError**: Ensure `real_estate.csv` is in the correct directory.
- **Jupyter Notebook Issues**: Restart the kernel and clear outputs if necessary.

## Submission
- Submit the required screenshots along with the `.ipynb` file if needed.
